Sure! Here is a simple `README.md` file for your `SimpleEventRegistration` smart contract project:

# SimpleEventRegistration Smart Contract

This is a simple smart contract for event registration that demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in Solidity.

## Contract Description

The `SimpleEventRegistration` contract allows participants to register their age and then checks if the age is within the valid range (21 to 65) using different Solidity statements.

## Functions

### `register(uint _age)`

This function sets the participant's age.



### `checkAssert()`

This function uses the `assert()` statement to ensure that the participant's age is between 21 and 65.


### `checkRequire()`

This function uses the `require()` statement to ensure that the participant's age is at least 21 years old and under 66 years old.



### `checkRevert()`

This function uses the `revert()` statement to ensure that the participant's age is between 21 and 65. If the age is outside this range, it reverts the transaction with an error message.



## Deployment

To deploy the contract, you can use any Ethereum development environment like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle. Below are the steps to deploy using Remix:

1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and paste the Solidity code for the `SimpleEventRegistration` contract.
3. Compile the contract.
4. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy" button in the Remix interface.

## Example Usage

1. Deploy the `SimpleEventRegistration` contract.
2. Call the `register` function with a valid age (e.g., 30).
3. Call the `checkAssert`, `checkRequire`, and `checkRevert` functions to verify the participant's age.
